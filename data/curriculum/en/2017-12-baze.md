Development of the web application and the internal management tools for **Baze**.

Baze is a solution which provides you with tailored dietary supplements based on blood samples and personal data.

My projects/responsibilities were :

- The web application using react/redux/react-native-web/apollo
- The internal management application using react/redux/apollo/redux-observable/Apollo
- The application for tracking the blood samples in the labs (react + apollo-link-rest)
- A GraphQL backend to manage the different surveys (graphql-yoga)
- A GraphQL backend to fine-tune the recommendation engine (graphcool + typescript)

This was my first experience using GraphQL in a production environment and it went extremely well. It would be hard to go back to REST after that!

Iâ€™ve also used this opportunity to participate actively in open-source projects like `graphql-yoga` and `apollo-link-rest`. After all, thereâ€™s nothing like an application in production to improve your tools ðŸ˜Š
