Working for a language-learning company with a B2C product! This was a short experience for me, with a very lovely team and exceptional company culture.

I had the pleasure to play a bit with:

- their latest premium feature: A group video chat!
- the voucher flow of their marketing website
- codemod to refactor the codebase (using generated apollo operations hooks)
- automating the translation flow with crowdin & github actions

But sometimes, life is about opportunity, and one of my best friends offered me an amazing position with a new company called Xata with a state-of-the-art database product and I couldn't turn down this challenge! üòÅ
