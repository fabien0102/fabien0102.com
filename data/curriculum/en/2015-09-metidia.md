My greatest adventure (until now)! Vinoga, the social farming game set in the worl of wine-making.

As a team of two developers, we implemented not only an entire game but also a complete developing environment to optimize our efficiency. I was personally responsible for the architecture of the servers and back-end. Architecture-wise, everything can be deployed and versionned on cloud formation, including a jenkins, a redis, and a system to manage docker instances. All of it is deployed continuously with 0 downtime.

The game in question is only accessible on Facebook and is entirely programmed using javascript. Many challenges were undertaken during these 2 years: performance, UI, A-B testing, occasional animations... In short, it was all good!

Using my personal experience in graphic design, I was also able to lead and train our graphics team and ensure handover. Furthermore, due to the specifics of working in a start-up environment, I endeavoured to help out wherever possible (shooting promotional videos, organizing events, designing graphical elements...). It wasn't always easy, but one thing is sure : I learned a lot from this experience!

Our last field of experimentation was project management. From "on-the-fly" development to the the implementation of agile methods (Scrum first, then Kanban), we were able to ascertain the pros and cons of each method, adapt them and learn from them.
