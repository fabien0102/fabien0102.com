One of the best trainings for working life, in my opinion, these two years of teamwork on a variety of projects have made me who I am today!

It was there, right after high school, that I truly experienced teamwork. It taught me the importance of good communication and organisation, which are still at the core of my profession today.

During that time, I was constantly in contact with professionals and have participated in projects with concrete results (fundraising "téléthon" in a mall, proposal for a communication campaign...).
