Back to a learning language company and B2C product! This was a short experience for me, with a very lovely team and exceptional company culture.

I had the pleasure to play a bit with:

- our latest premium feature: A group video chat!
- the voucher flow of our marketing website
- codemod to refactor the codebase (using generated apollo operations hooks)
- automated the translation flow with crowdin (github actions)

But sometime, life is about opportunity, and one of best friend proposed me an amazing offer at Xata, and, this was sounding way more fun! 😁 (and to be totally honest, I was not a huge fan of the DX around react-native anyway 😇)
