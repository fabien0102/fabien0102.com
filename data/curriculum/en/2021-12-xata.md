I’m really excited to be part of the founding team at Xata! A lot of challenges to solve, including:

- SDK generation
- Spreadsheet-like UI
- Data-visualization
- and many others…

As I’m writing this, the product doesn’t exist yet, but considering the team and the amount of cool ideas I've seen, I can’t wait to see the result! 😁
