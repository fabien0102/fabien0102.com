Fullstack TypeScript Engineer, specialized in React.

I really enjoy creating nice UX, resolving complex problems in a simple manner. To achieve this, I also spend a lot of time building tooling ; indeed, I'm deeply convinced that a nice DX and good tools will result in a better end-product (less bugs, easier to maintain, etc.).

Besides my passion for development, I like challenging myself by doing climbing, woodworking and making stuff in general. I love learning, and I'm not afraid of making mistakes!
